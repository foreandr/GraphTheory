PROBLEM NOTES:
- CHANGE PASSOWRDS TO HASHES OF PASSWORDS
- WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE USERNAME
- NOT NULL ON VARIOUS TABLES
- put some of my own money in the pool to start, maybe 1000$
- create fake account
- vc firm just to add capital for the raffle
- session storage reset passwords, and encrypt them
- make friendships unique
- figure out how to accept a pull request into my repo [essential]
- UNIT TESTING
- HAVE TO MAKE USERNAMES EXCLUSIVE
- FRIENDS MODEL VS FOLLWING MODEL?
- SECTION FOR THEM TO INPUT DESIRED FEATURES
- BONUS POINTS FOR SHOWING CODE
- have 1 add, people bid for it, bid goes into the pot
- COOKIES?
- overriding profile pic type jpg->png or whatever
- max file upload size
- take away abilities to upload when not on your own page
- add upload dates to files
- using full path in DB, can do so, but will need ot be changed for remote
- DIRECT DONATIONS ONLY 10% GOES TO ME OR SOMETHING INSANE
- filesize in FILE databse addition
- public block list
- personal block list
- friends list kind of broken
- infinite scrolling, don't just place, allow for requery when hit bottm

BUSINESS
